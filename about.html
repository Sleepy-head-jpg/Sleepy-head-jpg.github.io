      <p class="about-lead">
        I grew up noticing things other people walked past — a feather, a call from the canopy, 
        a footprint in mud. That habit of attention became my science.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a master's student studying community ecology, with a focus on how mixed-species 
        flocks of birds organize themselves in the Himalayan forests. My research asks a deceptively 
        simple question: when birds of different species decide to travel together, who leads, 
        who follows, and why? The answer, it turns out, touches everything from predation risk 
        to information sharing to the structure of the forest itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before I became a researcher, I was just a naturalist — someone who spent hours 
        in forests not collecting data, but simply watching. I think that background shapes 
        how I do science. I pay attention to the unexpected. I notice when the data doesn't 
        match what the animal seems to be doing. I trust my field notes as much as my R output.
      </p>

      <p>
        Photography came naturally from the same impulse. When you're trying to document 
        something rare, you learn to be very still, very patient, and very present. 
        The camera became a second field notebook — a way to record not just what I saw, 
        but how it felt to see it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work with tools that span both ends of the spectrum: binoculars and R, point counts 
        and GIS, field sketches and Python. I believe good ecology requires both — 
        the rigour of quantitative methods and the intimacy of watching a single bird 
        for an entire morning.
      </p>

        one morning walk at a time."

      <p>
        Outside of research, I'm an avid birder (you can find my eBird lists 
        <a href="#" class="inline-link">here</a>), a slow reader of natural history books, 
        and someone who believes that conservation is not just policy — it is a practice 
        of sustained attention.
